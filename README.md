# Suguru

This is a Suguru game written in HTML, JS and CSS.

It also has an algorithm which solves the majority of the levels. 

This program was written in about 3 days, for fun, and is not supported in any way. 

The levels are sourced from an Android app, of which the version from which they came is no longer available.
